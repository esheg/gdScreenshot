This is a screenshot tool to be used as a global script in Godot 4.x

By default it is set to work only in debug builds.

Set the script as an autoload and have a input called "screenshot" in the project settings.

Screenshots are saved in the users Godot project data directory, for example C:%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\your_project_name\screenshots

Files are named Project Name + Version + Date + Time in the png format.
